**Deepdive on Insights**

Used Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, and conditional logic to analyze revenue contribution, month-over-month growth, customer loyalty impact, cancellation rates, and estimated customer lifetime value.

1. **Revenue & Sales Performance Overview**

i. Revenue is not evenly distributed across transactions — a relatively small number of orders contribute disproportionately to total revenue.

ii. High-value transactions significantly lift overall sales, indicating the presence of premium purchases or bulk buying behavior. (This confirms the importance of focusing not just on volume, but also on order value optimization.)

**Key takeaway**: Revenue growth can be accelerated by targeting high-value orders rather than only increasing transaction count.

2. **Product Performance Analysis**

i. Certain product categories (e.g., Smartphones / Electronics) consistently outperform others in total revenue.

ii. Some products generate high revenue despite lower quantities, indicating premium pricing. 

iii. Other products sell frequently but contribute less revenue, explaining low-margin, high-volume behavior.

**Key takeaway**: The Product strategy should differentiate between revenue drivers and volume drivers, with tailored pricing and promotion strategies for each.

3. **Customer Segmentation & Loyalty Impact**

i. Loyalty members show higher average order values compared to non-members.

ii. Repeat purchase behavior is more common among loyalty members.

iii. This indicates that loyalty programs positively influence both customer retention and spend per customer.

**Key takeaway**: Investing in loyalty programs yields measurable revenue uplift and improves

4. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) & Top Customers**

i. A small group of customers contributes very high lifetime revenue (top 10 customers).

ii. These customers also tend to place multiple orders, reinforcing the Pareto principle (80/20 rule).

iii. Losing even a few of these customers would have a significant revenue impact.

**Key takeaway**: High-value customers should be prioritized with personalized offers, priority support, and retention strategies.

5. **Add-ons Impact on Revenue**

i. Orders with add-ons have a significantly higher average order value than those without.

ii. Add-ons clearly act as a revenue multiplier, not just an optional extra.

iii. Even a modest increase in add-on adoption could generate meaningful incremental revenue.

**Key takeaway**: Add-ons are a strong upsell lever and should be actively promoted at checkout or via recommendations.

6. **Order Behavior & Completion Analysis**

i. Completed orders represent the vast majority of revenue.

ii. Cancelled or incomplete orders contribute minimal value but may still incur operational costs.

iii. Improving conversion and reducing drop-offs directly improves revenue efficiency.

**Key takeaway**: Optimizing checkout experience and payment success rates has a direct, measurable revenue impact.
