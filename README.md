**Project Objective**

Analyze one year of e-commerce sales data to understand revenue drivers, customer behavior, product performance, and operational factors such as shipping and payment methods. The goal is to generate actionable business insights using Python, SQL, and interactive dashboards.

**Data Observation**

The dataset contains 20,000 e-commerce transactions across one year

Minimal missing data; missing add-on values (represent customers without add-on purchases)

Purchase Date stored as a string, requiring transformation

There is a mix of numerical and categorical variables, which is good for KPI and segmentation analysis
